# Compare React Component Libraries

Recently, I need to evaluate many React Component Libraries so I tried them all, compared and took some notes about them in a table format. Hope you find it useful.

Please note that I didn't intend to cover all libraries, only the ones with latest techs like Typescript, latest changes, etc.

## FAQ

Obviously not every library can be evaluated and added, but I also evaluated other libraries: Carbon (IBM), Rebass, Atlaskit, Fluent UI (Fabric, Microsoft), Lucid UI, Grommet, Spectrum, PatternFly, etc. They may get into this list later.
